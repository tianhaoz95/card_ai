your task is to build on top the bare minimal flutter app to build a credit card selector app. the app aims to help user always find the credit card with best reward when spending at the store.
the app uses flutter as the client framework. the app uses firebase as the backend. the app should only use firebase authentication and firestore and should not use any other firebase services.
the app should have the following screens:
1. login screen: login with email and password is supported.
2. spend screen: when the user is at a store or shopping online, the user should be able to type in information about the purchase in spend screen and tap a button to get the best credit card match. the spend screen should have a text field for the user to type in the purchase information and a button to submit the purchase information and get a credit card match.
3. card screen: card screen is for managing the user's credit cards. it shows a list of credit cards the user have. the card screen should have a floating add button for the user to add a new credit card. when the user taps on the add button, a pop up window should show up to let the user input the card name, and a url to fetch the card information. each card shown in the card screen should have buttons for editing the card, deleting the card.
4. settings screen: the settings screen should have buttons for sign out, delete the account and switch between languages.
the app should support internationalization for english and chinese. when the user switch between the languages in settings screen, all content in the app should switch language.
the app should use llm to get the best credit card match for the user base on the purchase information user provide. for the app to switch between llm service providers, a intereface for converting user purchase information to card match should be created to avoid complication when switching between llm service providers.
the app should use local llm. the app should use cactus as the llm provider. refer to https://www.cactuscompute.com/docs/flutter for how to integrate cactus with flutter. the llm provider can change in the future, so encapsulate the usage of cactus.
